       <p>I am an emerging professional in a workplace training program. For the past three years, I have been working at an accounting firm where I stepped into many roles and took on 
        any challenges presented. I enjoy learning new things and asking questions that create space for further conversation and added connections. In the future, I hope to become a 
        strong leader who can see more women in Csuite positions. I am seeking professional opportunities to advance within the tech field that deal with complex problems that require 
        a high-level of skill and nuance to overcome. </p>
       
       <p>I would be interested in getting to know your professional story and think it would be beneficial to connect over LinkedIn. </p>
